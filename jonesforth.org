* Introduction

Forth is one of those alien languages which most working programmers regard in the same
way as Haskell, Lisp, and so on.  Something so strange that they'd rather any thoughts
of it just go away so they can get on with writing this paying code.  But that's wrong
and if you care at all about programming then you should at least understand all these
languages, even if you will never use them.

Lisp is the ultimate high-level language, and features from Lisp are being added every
decade to the more common languages.  But Forth is in some ways the ultimate in low level
programming.  Out of the box it lacks features like dynamic memory management and even
strings.  In fact, at its primitive level it lacks even basic concepts like IF-statements
and loops.

Why then would you want to learn Forth?  There are several very good reasons.  First
and foremost, Forth is minimal.  You really can write a complete Forth in, say, 2000
lines of code.  I don't just mean a Forth program, I mean a complete Forth operating
system, environment and language.  You could boot such a Forth on a bare PC and it would
come up with a prompt where you could start doing useful work.  The Forth you have here
isn't minimal and uses a Linux process as its /base PC/ (both for the purposes of making
it a good tutorial). It's possible to completely understand the system.  Who can say they
completely understand how Linux works, or gcc?

Secondly Forth has a peculiar bootstrapping property.  By that I mean that after writing
a little bit of assembly to talk to the hardware and implement a few primitives, all the
rest of the language and compiler is written in Forth itself.  Remember I said before
that Forth lacked IF-statements and loops?  Well of course it doesn't really because
such a lanuage would be useless, but my point was rather that IF-statements and loops are
written in Forth itself.

Now of course this is common in other languages as well, and in those languages we call
them /libraries/.  For example in C, =printf= is a library function written in C.  But
in Forth this goes way beyond mere libraries.  Can you imagine writing C's =if= in C?
And that brings me to my third reason: If you can write =if= in Forth, then why restrict
yourself to the usual if/while/for/switch constructs?  You want a construct that iterates
over every other element in a list of numbers?  You can add it to the language.  What
about an operator which pulls in variables directly from a configuration file and makes
them available as Forth variables?  Or how about adding Makefile-like dependencies to
the language?  No problem in Forth.  How about modifying the Forth compiler to allow
complex inlining strategies -- simple.  This concept isn't common in programming languages,
but it has a name (in fact two names): "macros" (by which I mean Lisp-style macros, not
the lame C preprocessor) and "domain specific languages" (DSLs).

This tutorial isn't about learning Forth as the language.  I'll point you to some references
you should read if you're not familiar with using Forth.  This tutorial is about how to
write Forth.  In fact, until you understand how Forth is written, you'll have only a very
superficial understanding of how to use it.

So if you're not familiar with Forth or want to refresh your memory here are some online
references to read:

* Acknowledgements

This code draws heavily on the design of LINA Forth (http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/lina.html)
by Albert van der Horst.  Any similarities in the code are probably not accidental.

Some parts of this Forth are also based on this IOCCC entry from 1992:
http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/IOCCC/1992/buzzard.2.design.
I was very proud when Sean Barrett, the original author of the IOCCC entry, commented in the LtU thread
http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2452#comment-36818 about this Forth.

And finally I'd like to acknowledge the (possibly forgotten?) authors of ARTIC Forth because their
original program which I still have on original cassette tape kept nagging away at me all these years.

* Assembling

If you want to actually run this Forth, rather than just read it, you will need Linux on an
i386.  Linux because instead of programming directly to the hardware on a bare PC which I
could have done, I went for a simpler tutorial by assuming that the "hardware" is a Linux
process with a few basic system calls (read, write and exit and that's about all).  i386
is needed because I had to write the assembly for a processor, and i386 is by far the most
common.  (Of course when I say "i386", any 32- or 64-bit x86 processor will do.  I'm compiling
this on a 64 bit AMD Opteron).

Again, to assemble this you will need gcc and gas (the GNU assembler).  The commands to
assemble and run the code (save this file as "jonesforth.S") are:

#+begin_src shell
  gcc -m32 -nostdlib -static -Wl,-Ttext,0 -Wl,--build-id=none -o jonesforth jonesforth.S
  cat jonesforth.f - | ./jonesforth
#+end_src

If you want to run your own Forth programs you can do:

#+begin_src 
  cat jonesforth.f myprog.f | ./jonesforth
#+end_src

If you want to load your own Forth code and then continue reading user commands, you can do:

#+begin_src 
  cat jonesforth.f myfunctions.f - | ./jonesforth
#+end_src

* Assembler

(You can just skip to the next section -- you don't need to be able to read assembler to
follow this tutorial).

However if you do want to read the assembly code here are a few notes about gas (the GNU assembler):

1. Register names are prefixed with =%=, so %eax is the 32 bit i386 accumulator.  The registers
   available on i386 are: =%eax=, =%ebx=, =%ecx=, =%edx=, =%esi=, =%edi=, =%ebp=, and =%esp=, and most of them
   have special purposes.
2. Add, mov, etc. take arguments in the form SRC,DEST.  So =mov %eax,%ecx= moves =%eax= -> =%ecx=
3. Constants are prefixed with =$=, and you mustn't forget it!  If you forget it then it
   causes a read from memory instead, so:
   
   - =mov $2,%eax=         moves number 2 into =%eax=
   - =mov 2,%eax=          reads the 32 bit word from address 2 into %eax (ie. most likely a mistake)
   
4. gas has a funky syntax for local labels, where =1f= (etc.) means label =1:= "forwards"
   and =1b= (etc.) means label =1:= "backwards".  Notice that these labels might be mistaken
   for hex numbers (eg. you might confuse =1b= with =$0x1b=).
   1. =ja= is "jump if above", '=jb=' for "jump if below", =je= "jump if equal" etc.
5. gas has a reasonably nice .macro syntax, and I use them a lot to make the code shorter and
   less repetitive.

For more help reading the assembler, do "info gas" at the Linux prompt.

Now the tutorial starts in earnest.

* The Dictionary

In Forth as you will know, functions are called "words", and just as in other languages they
have a name and a definition.  Here are two Forth words:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE forth
        : DOUBLE DUP + ;                \ name is "DOUBLE", definition is "DUP +"
        : QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;     \ name is "QUADRUPLE", definition is "DOUBLE DOUBLE"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Words, both built-in ones and ones which the programmer defines later, are stored in a dictionary
which is just a linked list of dictionary entries.

#+begin_src ditaa :file 1.png
        <--- DICTIONARY ENTRY (HEADER) ----------------------->
        +------------------------+--------+---------- - - - - +----------- - - - -
        | LINK POINTER           | LENGTH/| NAME              | DEFINITION
        |                        | FLAGS  |                   |
        +--- (4 bytes) ----------+- byte -+- n bytes  - - - - +----------- - - - -
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:foo.png]]

I'll come to the definition of the word later.  For now just look at the header.  The first
4 bytes are the link pointer.  This points back to the previous word in the dictionary, or, for
the first word in the dictionary it is just a null pointer.  Then comes a length/flags byte.
The length of the word can be up to 31 characters (5 bits used) and the top three bits are used
for various flags which I'll come to later.  This is followed by the name itself, and in this
implementation the name is rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes by padding it with zero bytes.
That's just to ensure that the definition starts on a 32 bit boundary.

A Forth variable called =LATEST= contains a pointer to the most recently defined word, in
other words, the head of this linked list.

DOUBLE and QUADRUPLE might look like this:

	  #+begin_src ditaa :file 2.png
          pointer to previous word
           ^
           |
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | (definition ...)
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
           ^       len                         padding
           |
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
        | LINK    | 9 | Q | U | A | D | R | U | P | L | E | 0 | 0 | (definition ...)
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
           ^       len                                     padding
           |
           |
          LATEST
	  #+end_src

	  #+RESULTS:
	  [[file:foo.png]]

You should be able to see from this how you might implement functions to find a word in
the dictionary (just walk along the dictionary entries starting at =LATEST= and matching
the names until you either find a match or hit the null pointer at the end of the dictionary);
and add a word to the dictionary (create a new definition, set its =LINK= to =LATEST=, and set
=LATEST= to point to the new word).  We'll see precisely these functions implemented in
assembly code later on.

One interesting consequence of using a linked list is that you can redefine words, and
a newer definition of a word overrides an older one.  This is an important concept in
Forth because it means that any word (even "built-in" or "standard" words) can be
overridden with a new definition, either to enhance it, to make it faster or even to
disable it.  However because of the way that Forth words get compiled, which you'll
understand below, words defined using the old definition of a word continue to use
the old definition.  Only words defined after the new definition use the new definition.

* Direct Threaded Code

Now we'll get to the really crucial bit in understanding Forth, so go and get a cup of tea
or coffee and settle down.  It's fair to say that if you don't understand this section, then you
won't "get" how Forth works, and that would be a failure on my part for not explaining it well.
So if after reading this section a few times you don't understand it, please email me
(rich@annexia.org).

Let's talk first about what "threaded code" means.  Imagine a peculiar version of C where
you are only allowed to call functions without arguments.  (Don't worry for now that such a
language would be completely useless!)  So in our peculiar C, code would look like this:

	#+begin_example
        f ()
        {
          a ();
          b ();
          c ();
        }
	#+end_example

and so on.  How would a function, say =f= above, be compiled by a standard C compiler?
Probably into assembly code like this.  On the right hand side I've written the actual
i386 machine code.

	#+begin_example
        f:
          CALL a                        E8 08 00 00 00
          CALL b                        E8 1C 00 00 00
          CALL c                        E8 2C 00 00 00
          ; ignore the return from the function for now
	#+end_example

"=E8=" is the x86 machine code to =CALL= a function.  In the first 20 years of computing
memory was hideously expensive and we might have worried about the wasted space being used
by the repeated =E8= bytes.  We can save 20% in code size (and therefore, in expensive memory)
by compressing this into just:

	#+begin_example
        08 00 00 00             Just the function addresses, without
        1C 00 00 00             the CALL prefix.
        2C 00 00 00
	#+end_example

On a 16-bit machine like the ones which originally ran Forth the savings are even greater - 33%.

[Historical note: If the execution model that Forth uses looks strange from the following
paragraphs, then it was motivated entirely by the need to save memory on early computers.
This code compression isn't so important now when our machines have more memory in their L1
caches than those early computers had in total, but the execution model still has some
useful properties].

Of course this code won't run directly on the CPU any more.  Instead we need to write an
interpreter which takes each set of bytes and calls it.

On an i386 machine it turns out that we can write this interpreter rather easily, in just
two assembly instructions which turn into just 3 bytes of machine code.  Let's store the
pointer to the next word to execute in the =%esi= register:

#+begin_example :var guidotype=memory
                08 00 00 00     <- We're executing this one now.  %esi is the _next_ one to execute.
        %esi -> 1C 00 00 00
                2C 00 00 00
#+end_example

The all-important i386 instruction is called =LODSL= (or in Intel manuals, =LODSW=).  It does
two things.  Firstly it reads the memory at =%esi= into the accumulator (=%eax=).  Secondly it
increments =%esi= by 4 bytes.  So after =LODSL=, the situation now looks like this:

		#+begin_example
                08 00 00 00     <- We're still executing this one
                1C 00 00 00     <- %eax now contains this address (0x0000001C)
        %esi -> 2C 00 00 00
		#+end_example

Now we just need to jump to the address in =%eax=.  This is again just a single x86 instruction
written =JMP *(%eax)=.  And after doing the jump, the situation looks like:

		#+begin_example
                08 00 00 00
                1C 00 00 00     <- Now we're executing this subroutine.
        %esi -> 2C 00 00 00
		#+end_example

To make this work, each subroutine is followed by the two instructions '=LODSL; JMP *(%eax)='
which literally make the jump to the next subroutine.

And that brings us to our first piece of actual code!  Well, it's a macro.

#+begin_src asm
/* NEXT macro. */
        .macro NEXT
        lodsl           // Load 4 bytes at address esi into eax, then esi += 4
        jmp *(%eax)     // Jump to the address in eax
        .endm
#+end_src

This is the RV64 version.

#+begin_src asm
	.macro NEXT
	ld a0, 0(s1)    // Load doubleword at address s1 into a0
	addi s1, s1, 8  // s1 += 8
	ld t0, 0(a0)    // Load doubleword at address a0 into t0
	jalr t0         // Jump to address in t0
	.endm
#+end_src


The macro is called =NEXT=.  That's a Forth-ism.  It expands to those two instructions.

Every Forth primitive that we write has to be ended by =NEXT=.  Think of it kind of like
a return.

The above describes what is known as direct threaded code.

To sum up: We compress our function calls down to a list of addresses and use a somewhat
magical macro to act as a "jump to next function in the list".  We also use one register (=%esi=)
to act as a kind of instruction pointer, pointing to the next function in the list.

I'll just give you a hint of what is to come by saying that a Forth definition such as:

	#+begin_example
        : QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;
	#+end_example

actually compiles (almost, not precisely but we'll see why in a moment) to a list of
function addresses for =DOUBLE=, =DOUBLE= and a special function called =EXIT= to finish off.

At this point, /really eagle-eyed assembly experts/ are saying "/Jones, you've made a mistake!/".

I lied about =JMP *(%eax)=.

* Indirect Threaded Code

It turns out that direct threaded code is interesting but only if you want to just execute
a list of functions written in assembly language.  So =QUADRUPLE= would work only if =DOUBLE=
was an assembly language function.  In the direct threaded code, =QUADRUPLE= would look like:

		#+begin_src ditaa :file 3.png
                +------------------+
                | addr of DOUBLE  --------------------> (assembly code to do the double)
                +------------------+                    NEXT
        %esi -> | addr of DOUBLE   |
                +------------------+
		#+end_src

		#+RESULTS:
		[[file:foo.png]]

We can add an extra indirection to allow us to run both words written in assembly language
(primitives written for speed) and words written in Forth themselves as lists of addresses.

The extra indirection is the reason for the brackets in =JMP *(%eax)=.

Let's have a look at how =QUADRUPLE= and =DOUBLE= really look in Forth:

		#+begin_src ditaa :file 4.png
                : QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;

                +------------------+
                | codeword         |               : DOUBLE DUP + ;

                | addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
                +------------------+               | codeword         |
                | addr of DOUBLE   |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of DUP   --------------> +------------------+

                                                   +------------------+    |       |    ..            |
                                                                           |       |    ..            |
                                                                           |       | NEXT             |

                                                                                   |    ..            |
                                                                                   | NEXT             |
                                                                                   +------------------+
		#+end_src

        This is the part where you may need an extra cup of tea/coffee/favourite caffeinated
        beverage.  What has changed is that I've added an extra pointer to the beginning of
        the definitions.  In Forth this is sometimes called the "codeword".  The codeword is
        a pointer to the interpreter to run the function.  For primitives written in
        assembly language, the "interpreter" just points to the actual assembly code itself.
        They don't need interpreting, they just run.

        In words written in Forth (like =QUADRUPLE= and =DOUBLE=), the codeword points to an interpreter
        function.

        I'll show you the interpreter function shortly, but let's recall our indirect
        =JMP *(%eax)= with the "extra" brackets.  Take the case where we're executing =DOUBLE=
        as shown, and =dup= has been called.  Note that =%esi= is pointing to the address of =+=

        The assembly code for =DUP= eventually does a =NEXT=.  That:

        1. reads the address of =+= into =%eax=            =%eax= points to the codeword of =+=
        2. increments =%esi= by 4
        3. jumps to the indirect =%eaxk                    jumps to the address in the codeword of =+=, ie. the assembly code to implement =+=

        So I hope that I've convinced you that =NEXT= does roughly what you'd expect.  This is
        indirect threaded code.

        I've glossed over four things.  I wonder if you can guess without reading on what they are?

        .
        .
        .

        My list of four things are: (1) What does "=EXIT=" do?  (2) which is related to (1) is how do
        you call into a function, ie. how does =%esi= start off pointing at part of =QUADRUPLE=, but
        then point at part of =DOUBLE=.  (3) What goes in the codeword for the words which are written
        in Forth?  (4) How do you compile a function which does anything except call other functions
        ie. a function which contains a number like =: DOUBLE 2 * ;= ?

* The Interpreter and Return Stack

        Going at these in no particular order, let's talk about issues (3) and (2), the interpreter
        and the return stack.

        Words which are defined in Forth need a codeword which points to a little bit of code to
        give them a "helping hand" in life.  They don't need much, but they do need what is known
        as an "interpreter", although it doesn't really "interpret" in the same way that, say,
        Java bytecode used to be interpreted (ie. slowly).  This interpreter just sets up a few
        machine registers so that the word can then execute at full speed using the indirect
        threaded model above.

        One of the things that needs to happen when =QUADRUPLE= calls =DOUBLE= is that we save the old
        =%esi= ("instruction pointer") and create a new one pointing to the first word in =DOUBLE=.
        Because we will need to restore the old =%esi= at the end of =DOUBLE= (this is, after all, like
        a function call), we will need a stack to store these "return addresses" (old values of =%esi=).

        As you will have seen in the background documentation, Forth has two stacks, an ordinary
        stack for parameters, and a return stack which is a bit more mysterious.  But our return
        stack is just the stack I talked about in the previous paragraph, used to save =%esi= when
        calling from a Forth word into another Forth word.

        In this Forth, we are using the normal stack pointer (=%esp=) for the parameter stack.
        We will use the i386's "other" stack pointer (=%ebp=, usually called the "frame pointer")
        for our return stack.

        I've got two macros which just wrap up the details of using =%ebp= for the return stack.
        You use them as for example "=PUSHRSP %eax=" (push =%eax= on the return stack) or "=POPRSP %ebx="
        (pop top of return stack into =%ebx=).


#+begin_src asm
/* Macros to deal with the return stack. */
        .macro PUSHRSP reg
        lea -4(%ebp),%ebp       // push reg on to return stack
        movl \reg,(%ebp)
        .endm

        .macro POPRSP reg
        mov (%ebp),\reg         // pop top of return stack to reg
        lea 4(%ebp),%ebp
        .endm
#+end_src

        And with that we can now talk about the interpreter.

        In Forth the interpreter function is often called =DOCOL= (I think it means "DO COLON" because
        all Forth definitions start with a colon, as in =: DOUBLE DUP + ;=

        The "interpreter" (it's not really "interpreting") just needs to push the old =%esi= on the
        stack and set =%esi= to the first word in the definition.  Remember that we jumped to the
        function using =JMP *(%eax)=?  Well a consequence of that is that conveniently =%eax= contains
        the address of this codeword, so just by adding 4 to it we get the address of the first
        data word.  Finally after setting up =%esi=, it just does =NEXT= which causes that first word
        to run.

#+begin_src asm
/* DOCOL - the interpreter! */
        .text
        .align 4
DOCOL:
        PUSHRSP %esi            // push %esi on to the return stack
        addl $4,%eax            // %eax points to codeword, so make
        movl %eax,%esi          // %esi point to first data word
        NEXT
#+end_src

        Just to make this absolutely clear, let's see how =DOCOL= works when jumping from =QUADRUPLE=
        into =DOUBLE=:

		#+begin_example
                QUADRUPLE:
                +------------------+
                | codeword         |
                +------------------+               DOUBLE:
                | addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
                +------------------+       %eax -> | addr of DOCOL    |
        %esi -> | addr of DOUBLE   |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of DUP      |
                | addr of EXIT     |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | etc.             |
		#+end_example

        First, the call to =DOUBLE= calls =DOCOL= (the codeword of =DOUBLE=).  =DOCOL= does this:  It
        pushes the old =%esi= on the return stack.  =%eax= points to the codeword of =DOUBLE=, so we
        just add 4 on to it to get our new =%esi=:

		#+begin_example
                QUADRUPLE:
                +------------------+
                | codeword         |
                +------------------+               DOUBLE:
                | addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
top of return   +------------------+       %eax -> | addr of DOCOL    |
stack points -> | addr of DOUBLE   |       + 4 =   +------------------+
                +------------------+       %esi -> | addr of DUP      |
                | addr of EXIT     |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | etc.             |
		#+end_example

        Then we do =NEXT=, and because of the magic of threaded code that increments =%esi= again
        and calls =DUP=.

        Well, it seems to work.

        One minor point here.  Because =DOCOL= is the first bit of assembly actually to be defined
        in this file (the others were just macros), and because I usually compile this code with the
        text segment starting at address 0, =DOCOL= has address 0.  So if you are disassembling the
        code and see a word with a codeword of 0, you will immediately know that the word is
        written in Forth (it's not an assembler primitive) and so uses =DOCOL= as the interpreter.

* Starting Up

        Now let's get down to nuts and bolts.  When we start the program we need to set up
        a few things like the return stack.  But as soon as we can, we want to jump into Forth
        code (albeit much of the "early" Forth code will still need to be written as
        assembly language primitives).

        This is what the set up code does.  Does a tiny bit of house-keeping, sets up the
        separate return stack (/NB/: Linux gives us the ordinary parameter stack already), then
        immediately jumps to a Forth word called =QUIT=.  Despite its name, =QUIT= doesn't quit
        anything.  It resets some internal state and starts reading and interpreting commands.
        (The reason it is called =QUIT= is because you can call =QUIT= from your own Forth code
        to "quit" your program and go back to interpreting).

#+begin_src asm
/* Assembler entry point. */
        .text
        .globl _start
_start:
        cld
        mov %esp,var_S0         // Save the initial data stack pointer in Forth variable S0.
        mov $return_stack_top,%ebp // Initialise the return stack.
        call set_up_data_segment

        mov $cold_start,%esi    // Initialise interpreter.
        NEXT                    // Run interpreter!

        .section .rodata
cold_start:                     // High-level code without a codeword.
        .int QUIT
#+end_src

* Built-In Words

        Remember our dictionary entries (headers)?  Let's bring those together with the codeword
        and data words to see how =: DOUBLE DUP + ;= really looks in memory.

	  #+begin_example
          pointer to previous word
           ^
           |
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+--|---------+------------+------------+
           ^       len                         pad  codeword      |
           |                                                      V
          LINK in next word                             points to codeword of DUP
	  #+end_example
        
        Initially we can't just write "=: DOUBLE DUP + ;=" (ie. that literal string) here because we
        don't yet have anything to read the string, break it up at spaces, parse each word, etc. etc.
        So instead we will have to define built-in words using the GNU assembler data constructors
        (like =.int=, =.byte=, =.string=, =.ascii= and so on -- look them up in the gas info page if you are
        unsure of them).

        The long way would be:

	#+begin_example asm
        .int <link to previous word>
        .byte 6                 // len
        .ascii "DOUBLE"         // string
        .byte 0                 // padding
DOUBLE: .int DOCOL              // codeword
        .int DUP                // pointer to codeword of DUP
        .int PLUS               // pointer to codeword of +
        .int EXIT               // pointer to codeword of EXIT
	#+end_example

        That's going to get quite tedious rather quickly, so here I define an assembler macro
        so that I can just write:

	#+begin_example asm
        defword "DOUBLE",6,,DOUBLE
        .int DUP,PLUS,EXIT
	#+end_example

        and I'll get exactly the same effect.

        Don't worry too much about the exact implementation details of this macro - it's complicated!


#+begin_src asm
/* Flags - these are discussed later. */
        .set F_IMMED,0x80
        .set F_HIDDEN,0x20
        .set F_LENMASK,0x1f     // length mask

        // Store the chain of links.
        .set link,0

        .macro defword name, namelen, flags=0, label
        .section .rodata
        .align 4
        .globl name_\label
name_\label :
        .int link               // link
        .set link,name_\label
        .byte \flags+\namelen   // flags + length byte
        .ascii "\name"          // the name
        .align 4                // padding to next 4 byte boundary
        .globl \label
\label :
        .int DOCOL              // codeword - the interpreter
        // list of word pointers follow
        .endm
#+end_src

        Similarly I want a way to write words written in assembly language.  There will be quite a few
        of these to start with because, well, everything has to start in assembly before there's
        enough "infrastructure" to be able to start writing Forth words, but also I want to define
        some common Forth words in assembly language for speed, even though I could write them in Forth.

        This is what =DUP= looks like in memory:

	  #+begin_example
          pointer to previous word
           ^
           |
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+------------+
        | LINK    | 3 | D | U | P | code_DUP ---------------------> points to the assembly
        +---------+---+---+---+---+------------+                    code used to write DUP,
           ^       len              codeword                        which ends with NEXT.
           |
          LINK in next word
	  #+end_example

        Again, for brevity in writing the header I'm going to write an assembler macro called defcode.
        As with defword above, don't worry about the complicated details of the macro.


	#+begin_src asm
        .macro defcode name, namelen, flags=0, label
        .section .rodata
        .align 4
        .globl name_\label
name_\label :
        .int link               // link
        .set link,name_\label
        .byte \flags+\namelen   // flags + length byte
        .ascii "\name"          // the name
        .align 4                // padding to next 4 byte boundary
        .globl \label
\label :
        .int code_\label        // codeword
        .text
        //.align 4
        .globl code_\label
code_\label :                   // assembler code follows
        .endm
	#+end_src


        Now some easy Forth primitives.  These are written in assembly for speed.  If you understand
        i386 assembly language then it is worth reading these.  However if you don't understand assembly
        you can skip the details.

        In this Forth, only =/MOD= is primitive.  Later we will define the =/= and =MOD= words in
        terms of the primitive =/MOD=.  The design of the i386 assembly instruction =idiv= which
        leaves both quotient and remainder makes this the obvious choice.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "/MOD",4,,DIVMOD

        Lots of comparison operations like =, <, >, etc..

        ANS Forth says that the comparison words should return all (binary) 1's for
        True and all 0's for False.  However this is a bit of a strange convention
        so this Forth breaks it and returns the more normal (for C programmers ...)
        1 meaning True and 0 meaning False.

* Returning From Forth Words

        Time to talk about what happens when we =EXIT= a function.  In this diagram =QUADRUPLE= has called
        =DOUBLE=, and =DOUBLE= is about to exit (look at where %esi is pointing):

		#+begin_example
                QUADRUPLE
                +------------------+
                | codeword         |
                +------------------+               DOUBLE
                | addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
                +------------------+               | codeword         |
                | addr of DOUBLE   |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of DUP      |
                | addr of EXIT     |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of +        |
                                                   +------------------+
                                           %esi -> | addr of EXIT     |
                                                   +------------------+
		#+end_example

        What happens when the + function does =NEXT=?  Well, the following code is executed.

	#+begin_example asm
        defcode "EXIT",4,,EXIT
        POPRSP %esi             // pop return stack into %esi
        NEXT
	#+end_example

        =EXIT= gets the old =%esi= which we saved from before on the return stack, and puts it in =%esi=.
        So after this (but just before =NEXT=) we get:

		#+begin_example
                QUADRUPLE
                +------------------+
                | codeword         |
                +------------------+               DOUBLE
                | addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
                +------------------+               | codeword         |
        %esi -> | addr of DOUBLE   |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of DUP      |
                | addr of EXIT     |               +------------------+
                +------------------+               | addr of +        |
                                                   +------------------+
                                                   | addr of EXIT     |
                                                   +------------------+
		#+end_example

        And =NEXT= just completes the job by, well, in this case just by calling =DOUBLE= again :-)

* Literals

        The final point I "glossed over" before was how to deal with functions that do anything
        apart from calling other functions.  For example, suppose that =DOUBLE= was defined like this:

	#+begin_example forth
        : DOUBLE 2 * ;
	#+end_example

        It does the same thing, but how do we compile it since it contains the literal 2?  One way
        would be to have a function called "2" (which you'd have to write in assembler), but you'd need
        a function for every single literal that you wanted to use.

        Forth solves this by compiling the function using a special word called =LIT=:

	#+begin_example
        +---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | (usual header of DOUBLE)  | DOCOL | LIT   | 2     | *     | EXIT  |
        +---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	#+end_example

        =LIT= is executed in the normal way, but what it does next is definitely not normal.  It
        looks at =%esi= (which now points to the number 2), grabs it, pushes it on the stack, then
        manipulates =%esi= in order to skip the number as if it had never been there.

        What's neat is that the whole grab/manipulate can be done using a single byte single
        i386 instruction, our old friend =LODSL=.  Rather than me drawing more ASCII-art diagrams,
        see if you can find out how =LIT= works:

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "LIT",3,,LIT
        // %esi points to the next command, but in this case it points to the next
        // literal 32 bit integer.  Get that literal into %eax and increment %esi.
        // On x86, it's a convenient single byte instruction!  (cf. NEXT macro)
        lodsl
        push %eax               // push the literal number on to stack
        NEXT
	#+end_src

* Memory

        An important point about Forth is that it gives you direct access to the lowest levels
        of the machine.  Manipulating memory directly is done frequently in Forth, and these are
        the primitive words for doing it.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "!",1,,STORE
        pop %ebx                // address to store at
        pop %eax                // data to store there
        mov %eax,(%ebx)         // store it
        NEXT

        defcode "@",1,,FETCH
        pop %ebx                // address to fetch
        mov (%ebx),%eax         // fetch it
        push %eax               // push value onto stack
        NEXT

        defcode "+!",2,,ADDSTORE
        pop %ebx                // address
        pop %eax                // the amount to add
        addl %eax,(%ebx)        // add it
        NEXT

        defcode "-!",2,,SUBSTORE
        pop %ebx                // address
        pop %eax                // the amount to subtract
        subl %eax,(%ebx)        // add it
        NEXT
	#+end_src

        =!= and =@= (=STORE= and =FETCHk) store 32-bit words.  It's also useful to be able to read and write bytes
        so we also define standard words =C@= and =C!=.

        Byte-oriented operations only work on architectures which permit them (i386 is one of those).


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "C!",2,,STOREBYTE
        pop %ebx                // address to store at
        pop %eax                // data to store there
        movb %al,(%ebx)         // store it
        NEXT

        defcode "C@",2,,FETCHBYTE
        pop %ebx                // address to fetch
        xor %eax,%eax
        movb (%ebx),%al         // fetch it
        push %eax               // push value onto stack
        NEXT

/* C@C! is a useful byte copy primitive. */
        defcode "C@C!",4,,CCOPY
        movl 4(%esp),%ebx       // source address
        movb (%ebx),%al         // get source character
        pop %edi                // destination address
        stosb                   // copy to destination
        push %edi               // increment destination address
        incl 4(%esp)            // increment source address
        NEXT

/* and CMOVE is a block copy operation. */
        defcode "CMOVE",5,,CMOVE
        mov %esi,%edx           // preserve %esi
        pop %ecx                // length
        pop %edi                // destination address
        pop %esi                // source address
        rep movsb               // copy source to destination
        mov %edx,%esi           // restore %esi
        NEXT
	#+end_src

* Built-In Variables

        These are some built-in variables and related standard Forth words.  Of these, the only one that we
        have discussed so far was =LATEST=, which points to the last (most recently defined) word in the
        Forth dictionary.  =LATEST= is also a Forth word which pushes the address of =LATEST= (the variable)
        on to the stack, so you can read or write it using =@= and =!= operators.  For example, to print
        the current value of =LATEST= (and this can apply to any Forth variable) you would do:

	#+begin_example forth
        LATEST @ . CR
	#+end_example

        To make defining variables shorter, I'm using a macro called defvar, similar to defword and
        defcode above.  (In fact the defvar macro uses defcode to do the dictionary header).

	#+begin_src asm
        .macro defvar name, namelen, flags=0, label, initial=0
        defcode \name,\namelen,\flags,\label
        push $var_\name
        NEXT
        .data
        .align 4
var_\name :
        .int \initial
        .endm
	#+end_src

        The built-in variables are:

        - =STATE=           Is the interpreter executing code (0) or compiling a word (non-zero)?
        - =LATEST=          Points to the latest (most recently defined) word in the dictionary.
        - =HERE=            Points to the next free byte of memory.  When compiling, compiled words go here.
        - =S0=              Stores the address of the top of the parameter stack.
        - =BASE=            The current base for printing and reading numbers.


	#+begin_src asm
        defvar "STATE",5,,STATE
        defvar "HERE",4,,HERE
        defvar "LATEST",6,,LATEST,name_SYSCALL0 // SYSCALL0 must be last in built-in dictionary
        defvar "S0",2,,SZ
        defvar "BASE",4,,BASE,10
	#+end_src

* Built-In Constants

        It's also useful to expose a few constants to Forth.  When the word is executed it pushes a
        constant value on the stack.

        The built-in constants are:

        - =VERSION=         Is the current version of this Forth.
        - =R0=              The address of the top of the return stack.
        - =DOCOL=           Pointer to DOCOL.
        - =F_IMMED=         The IMMEDIATE flag's actual value.
        - =F_HIDDEN=        The HIDDEN flag's actual value.
        - =F_LENMASK=       The length mask in the flags/len byte.
        - =SYS_*=           and the numeric codes of various Linux syscalls (from <asm/unistd.h>)

#+begin_src asm
#include <asm-i386/unistd.h>

        .macro defconst name, namelen, flags=0, label, value
        defcode \name,\namelen,\flags,\label
        push $\value
        NEXT
        .endm

        defconst "VERSION",7,,VERSION,JONES_VERSION
        defconst "R0",2,,RZ,return_stack_top

        defconst "O_NONBLOCK",10,,__O_NONBLOCK,04000
#+end_src

* Return Stack

        These words allow you to access the return stack.  Recall that the register %ebp always points to
        the top of the return stack.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode ">R",2,,TOR
        pop %eax                // pop parameter stack into %eax
        PUSHRSP %eax            // push it on to the return stack
        NEXT

        defcode "R>",2,,FROMR
        POPRSP %eax             // pop return stack on to %eax
        push %eax               // and push on to parameter stack
        NEXT

        defcode "RSP@",4,,RSPFETCH
        push %ebp
        NEXT

        defcode "RSP!",4,,RSPSTORE
        pop %ebp
        NEXT

        defcode "RDROP",5,,RDROP
        addl $4,%ebp            // pop return stack and throw away
        NEXT
	#+end_src


* Parameter (Data) Stack

        These functions allow you to manipulate the parameter stack.  Recall that Linux sets up the parameter
        stack for us, and it is accessed through =%esp=.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "DSP@",4,,DSPFETCH
        mov %esp,%eax

* Input and Output

        These are our first really meaty/complicated Forth primitives.  I have chosen to write them in
        assembler, but surprisingly in "real" Forth implementations these are often written in terms
        of more fundamental Forth primitives.  I chose to avoid that because I think that just obscures
        the implementation.  After all, you may not understand assembler but you can just think of it
        as an opaque block of code that does what it says.

        Let's discuss input first.

        The Forth word KEY reads the next byte from stdin (and pushes it on the parameter stack).
        So if KEY is called and someone hits the space key, then the number 32 (ASCII code of space)
        is pushed on the stack.

        In Forth there is no distinction between reading code and reading input.  We might be reading
        and compiling code, we might be reading words to execute, we might be asking for the user
        to type their name -- ultimately it all comes in through KEY.

        The implementation of KEY uses an input buffer of a certain size (defined at the end of this
        file).  It calls the Linux read(2) system call to fill this buffer and tracks its position
        in the buffer using a couple of variables, and if it runs out of input buffer then it refills
        it automatically.  The other thing that KEY does is if it detects that stdin has closed, it
        exits the program, which is why when you hit ^D the Forth system cleanly exits.

        Back to input, WORD is a Forth word which reads the next full word of input.

        What it does in detail is that it first skips any blanks (spaces, tabs, newlines and so on).
        Then it calls KEY to read characters into an internal buffer until it hits a blank.  Then it
        calculates the length of the word it read and returns the address and the length as
        two words on the stack (with the length at the top of stack).

        Notice that WORD has a single internal buffer which it overwrites each time (rather like
        a static C string).  Also notice that WORD's internal buffer is just 32 bytes long and
        there is NO checking for overflow.  31 bytes happens to be the maximum length of a
        Forth word that we support, and that is what WORD is used for: to read Forth words when
        we are compiling and executing code.  The returned strings are not NUL-terminated.

        Start address+length is the normal way to represent strings in Forth (not ending in an
        ASCII NUL character as in C), and so Forth strings can contain any character including NULs
        and can be any length.

        WORD is not suitable for just reading strings (eg. user input) because of all the above
        peculiarities and limitations.

        Note that when executing, you'll see:
        WORD FOO
        which puts "FOO" and length 3 on the stack, but when compiling:
        : BAR WORD FOO ;
        is an error (or at least it doesn't do what you might expect).  Later we'll talk about compiling
        and immediate mode, and you'll understand why.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "WORD",4,,WORD
        call _WORD
        push %edi               // push base address
        push %ecx               // push length
        NEXT

_WORD:
        /* Search for first non-blank character.  Also skip \ comments. */

        call _KEY               // get next key, returned in %eax

        .data                   // NB: easier to fit in the .data section
        // A static buffer where WORD returns.  Subsequent calls
        // overwrite this buffer.  Maximum word length is 32 chars.
word_buffer:
        .space 32
	#+end_src


        As well as reading in words we'll need to read in numbers and for that we are using a function
        called NUMBER.  This parses a numeric string such as one returned by WORD and pushes the
        number on the parameter stack.

        The function uses the variable BASE as the base (radix) for conversion, so for example if
        BASE is 2 then we expect a binary number.  Normally BASE is 10.

        If the word starts with a '-' character then the returned value is negative.

        If the string can't be parsed as a number (or contains characters outside the current BASE)
        then we need to return an error indication.  So NUMBER actually returns two items on the stack.
        At the top of stack we return the number of unconverted characters (ie. if 0 then all characters
        were converted, so there is no error).  Second from top of stack is the parsed number or a
        partial value if there was an error.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "NUMBER",6,,NUMBER
        pop %ecx                // length of string
        pop %edi                // start address of string
        call _NUMBER
        push %eax               // parsed number
        push %ecx               // number of unparsed characters (0 = no error)
        NEXT

_NUMBER:
        xor %eax,%eax
        xor %ebx,%ebx

        test %ecx,%ecx          // trying to parse a zero-length string is an error, but will return 0.
        jz 5f

        movl var_BASE,%edx      // get BASE (in %dl)

        // Check if first character is '-'.
        movb (%edi),%bl         // %bl = first character in string
        inc %edi
        push %eax               // push 0 on stack

* Dictionary Look Ups

        We're building up to our prelude on how Forth code is compiled, but first we need yet more infrastructure.

        The Forth word FIND takes a string (a word as parsed by WORD -- see above) and looks it up in the
        dictionary.  What it actually returns is the address of the dictionary header, if it finds it,
        or 0 if it didn't.

        So if DOUBLE is defined in the dictionary, then WORD DOUBLE FIND returns the following pointer:

    #+begin_example
    pointer to this
        |
        |
        V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
    #+end_example

        See also >CFA and >DFA.

        FIND doesn't find dictionary entries which are flagged as HIDDEN.  See below for why.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "FIND",4,,FIND
        pop %ecx                // %ecx = length
        pop %edi                // %edi = address
        call _FIND
        push %eax               // %eax = address of dictionary entry (or NULL)
        NEXT

_FIND:
        push %esi               // Save %esi so we can use it in string comparison.

        // Now we start searching backwards through the dictionary for this word.
        mov var_LATEST,%edx     // LATEST points to name header of the latest word in the dictionary
1:      test %edx,%edx          // NULL pointer?  (end of the linked list)
        je 4f

        // Compare the length expected and the length of the word.
        // Note that if the F_HIDDEN flag is set on the word, then by a bit of trickery
        // this won't pick the word (the length will appear to be wrong).
        xor %eax,%eax
        movb 4(%edx),%al        // %al = flags+length field
        andb $(F_HIDDEN|F_LENMASK),%al // %al = name length
        cmpb %cl,%al            // Length is the same?
        jne 2f

        // Compare the strings in detail.
        push %ecx               // Save the length
        push %edi               // Save the address (repe cmpsb will move this pointer)
        lea 5(%edx),%esi        // Dictionary string we are checking against.
        repe cmpsb              // Compare the strings.
        pop %edi
        pop %ecx
        jne 2f                  // Not the same.

        // The strings are the same - return the header pointer in %eax
        pop %esi
        mov %edx,%eax
        ret

2:      mov (%edx),%edx         // Move back through the link field to the previous word
        jmp 1b                  // .. and loop.

4:      // Not found.
        pop %esi
        xor %eax,%eax           // Return zero to indicate not found.
        ret
	#+end_src

        FIND returns the dictionary pointer, but when compiling we need the codeword pointer (recall
        that Forth definitions are compiled into lists of codeword pointers).  The standard Forth
        word >CFA turns a dictionary pointer into a codeword pointer.

        The example below shows the result of:

		#+begin_example
                WORD DOUBLE FIND >CFA

        FIND returns a pointer to this
        |                               >CFA converts it to a pointer to this
        |                                          |
        V                                          V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                                                   codeword
		#+end_example

        Notes:

        Because names vary in length, this isn't just a simple increment.

        In this Forth you cannot easily turn a codeword pointer back into a dictionary entry pointer, but
        that is not true in most Forth implementations where they store a back pointer in the definition
        (with an obvious memory/complexity cost).  The reason they do this is that it is useful to be
        able to go backwards (codeword -> dictionary entry) in order to decompile Forth definitions
        quickly.

        What does CFA stand for?  My best guess is "Code Field Address".


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode ">CFA",4,,TCFA
        pop %edi
        call _TCFA
        push %edi
        NEXT
_TCFA:
        xor %eax,%eax
        add $4,%edi             // Skip link pointer.
        movb (%edi),%al         // Load flags+len into %al.
        inc %edi                // Skip flags+len byte.
        andb $F_LENMASK,%al     // Just the length, not the flags.
        add %eax,%edi           // Skip the name.
        addl $3,%edi            // The codeword is 4-byte aligned.
        andl $~3,%edi
        ret
	#+end_src

        Related to >CFA is >DFA which takes a dictionary entry address as returned by FIND and
        returns a pointer to the first data field.

	#+begin_example
        FIND returns a pointer to this
        |                               >CFA converts it to a pointer to this
        |                                          |
        |                                          |    >DFA converts it to a pointer to this
        |                                          |             |
        V                                          V             V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                                                   codeword
	#+end_example

        (Note to those following the source of FIG-Forth / ciforth: My >DFA definition is
        different from theirs, because they have an extra indirection).

        You can see that >DFA is easily defined in Forth just by adding 4 to the result of >CFA.


	#+begin_src asm
        defword ">DFA",4,,TDFA
        .int TCFA               // >CFA         (get code field address)
        .int INCR4              // 4+           (add 4 to it to get to next word)
        .int EXIT               // EXIT         (return from Forth word)
	#+end_src


* Compiling

        Now we'll talk about how Forth compiles words.  Recall that a word definition looks like this:

		#+begin_example forth
                : DOUBLE DUP + ;
		#+end_example

        and we have to turn this into:

	  #+begin_example
          pointer to previous word
           ^
           |
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+--|---------+------------+------------+
           ^       len                         pad  codeword      |
           |                                                      V
          LATEST points here                            points to codeword of DUP

        There are several problems to solve.  Where to put the new word?  How do we read words?  How
        do we define the words : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON)?

        Forth solves this rather elegantly and as you might expect in a very low-level way which
        allows you to change how the compiler works on your own code.

        Forth has an INTERPRET function (a true interpreter this time, not DOCOL) which runs in a
        loop, reading words (using WORD), looking them up (using FIND), turning them into codeword
        pointers (using >CFA) and deciding what to do with them.

        What it does depends on the mode of the interpreter (in variable STATE).

        When STATE is zero, the interpreter just runs each word as it looks them up.  This is known as
        immediate mode.

        The interesting stuff happens when STATE is non-zero -- compiling mode.  In this mode the
        interpreter appends the codeword pointer to user memory (the HERE variable points to the next
        free byte of user memory -- see DATA SEGMENT section below).

        So you may be able to see how we could define : (COLON).  The general plan is:

        (1) Use WORD to read the name of the function being defined.

        (2) Construct the dictionary entry -- just the header part -- in user memory:

    #+begin_example
    pointer to previous word (from LATEST)                      +-- Afterwards, HERE points here, where
           ^                                                    |   the interpreter will start appending
           |                                                    V   codewords.
        +--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword
    #+end_example

        (3) Set LATEST to point to the newly defined word, ...

        (4) .. and most importantly leave HERE pointing just after the new codeword.  This is where
            the interpreter will append codewords.

        (5) Set STATE to 1.  This goes into compile mode so the interpreter starts appending codewords to
            our partially-formed header.

        After : has run, our input is here:

	#+begin_example
        : DOUBLE DUP + ;
                 ^
                 |
                Next byte returned by KEY will be the 'D' character of DUP
	#+end_example

        so the interpreter (now it's in compile mode, so I guess it's really the compiler) reads "DUP",
        looks it up in the dictionary, gets its codeword pointer, and appends it:

									     #+begin_example
                                                                             +-- HERE updated to point here.
                                                                             |
                                                                             V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword

        Next we read +, get the codeword pointer, and append it:

                                                                                          +-- HERE updated to point here.
                                                                                          |
                                                                                          V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword
									     #+end_example

        The issue is what happens next.  Obviously what we _don't_ want to happen is that we
        read ";" and compile it and go on compiling everything afterwards.

        At this point, Forth uses a trick.  Remember the length byte in the dictionary definition
        isn't just a plain length byte, but can also contain flags.  One flag is called the
        IMMEDIATE flag (F_IMMED in this code).  If a word in the dictionary is flagged as
        IMMEDIATE then the interpreter runs it immediately _even if it's in compile mode_.

        This is how the word ; (SEMICOLON) works -- as a word flagged in the dictionary as IMMEDIATE.

        And all it does is append the codeword for EXIT on to the current definition and switch
        back to immediate mode (set STATE back to 0).  Shortly we'll see the actual definition
        of ; and we'll see that it's really a very simple definition, declared IMMEDIATE.

        After the interpreter reads ; and executes it 'immediately', we get this:

	#+begin_example
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword                                           ^
                                                                                                       |
                                                                                                      HERE
	#+end_example
        STATE is set to 0.

        And that's it, job done, our new definition is compiled, and we're back in immediate mode
        just reading and executing words, perhaps including a call to test our new word DOUBLE.

        The only last wrinkle in this is that while our word was being compiled, it was in a
        half-finished state.  We certainly wouldn't want DOUBLE to be called somehow during
        this time.  There are several ways to stop this from happening, but in Forth what we
        do is flag the word with the HIDDEN flag (F_HIDDEN in this code) just while it is
        being compiled.  This prevents FIND from finding it, and thus in theory stops any
        chance of it being called.

        The above explains how compiling, : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON) works and in a moment I'm
        going to define them.  The : (COLON) function can be made a little bit more general by writing
        it in two parts.  The first part, called CREATE, makes just the header:

						   #+begin_example
                                                   +-- Afterwards, HERE points here.
                                                   |
                                                   V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                   len                         pad
						   #+end_example

        and the second part, the actual definition of : (COLON), calls CREATE and appends the
        DOCOL codeword, so leaving:

								#+begin_example
                                                                +-- Afterwards, HERE points here.
                                                                |
                                                                V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword
								#+end_example

        CREATE is a standard Forth word and the advantage of this split is that we can reuse it to
        create other types of words (not just ones which contain code, but words which contain variables,
        constants and other data).


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "CREATE",6,,CREATE

        // Get the name length and address.
        pop %ecx                // %ecx = length
        pop %ebx                // %ebx = address of name

        // Link pointer.
        movl var_HERE,%edi      // %edi is the address of the header
        movl var_LATEST,%eax    // Get link pointer
        stosl                   // and store it in the header.

        // Length byte and the word itself.
        mov %cl,%al             // Get the length.
        stosb                   // Store the length/flags byte.
        push %esi
        mov %ebx,%esi           // %esi = word
        rep movsb               // Copy the word
        pop %esi
        addl $3,%edi            // Align to next 4 byte boundary.
        andl $~3,%edi

        // Update LATEST and HERE.
        movl var_HERE,%eax
        movl %eax,var_LATEST
        movl %edi,var_HERE
        NEXT
	#+end_src


        Because I want to define : (COLON) in Forth, not assembler, we need a few more Forth words
        to use.

        The first is , (COMMA) which is a standard Forth word which appends a 32 bit integer to the user
        memory pointed to by HERE, and adds 4 to HERE.  So the action of , (COMMA) is:

							#+begin_example
                                                        previous value of HERE
                                                                 |
                                                                 V
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-- - - - - --+------------+
        | LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 |             |  <data>    |
        +---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-- - - - - --+------------+
                   len                         pad                            ^
                                                                              |
                                                                        new value of HERE
							#+end_example

        and <data> is whatever 32 bit integer was at the top of the stack.

        , (COMMA) is quite a fundamental operation when compiling.  It is used to append codewords
        to the current word that is being compiled.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode ",",1,,COMMA
        pop %eax                // Code pointer to store.
        call _COMMA
        NEXT
_COMMA:
        movl var_HERE,%edi      // HERE
        stosl                   // Store it.
        movl %edi,var_HERE      // Update HERE (incremented)
        ret
	#+end_src

        Our definitions of =:= (=COLON=) and =;= (=SEMICOLON=) will need to switch to and from compile mode.

        Immediate mode vs. compile mode is stored in the global variable =STATE=, and by updating this
        variable we can switch between the two modes.

        For various reasons which may become apparent later, Forth defines two standard words called
        =[= and =]= (=LBRAC= and =RBRAC=) which switch between modes:

        Word    Assembler       Action          Effect
        [       LBRAC           STATE := 0      Switch to immediate mode.
        ]       RBRAC           STATE := 1      Switch to compile mode.

        =[= (=LBRAC=) is an IMMEDIATE word.  The reason is as follows: If we are in compile mode and the
        interpreter saw [ then it would compile it rather than running it.  We would never be able to
        switch back to immediate mode!  So we flag the word as IMMEDIATE so that even in compile mode
        the word runs immediately, switching us back to immediate mode.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "[",1,F_IMMED,LBRAC
        xor %eax,%eax
        movl %eax,var_STATE     // Set STATE to 0.
        NEXT

        defcode "]",1,,RBRAC
        movl $1,var_STATE       // Set STATE to 1.
        NEXT
	#+end_src

        Now we can define =:= (=COLON=) using =CREATE=.  It just calls =CREATE=, appends =DOCOL= (the codeword), sets
        the word =HIDDEN= and goes into compile mode.

	#+begin_src asm
        defword ":",1,,COLON
        .int WORD               // Get the name of the new word
        .int CREATE             // CREATE the dictionary entry / header
        .int LIT, DOCOL, COMMA  // Append DOCOL  (the codeword).
        .int LATEST, FETCH, HIDDEN // Make the word hidden (see below for definition).
        .int RBRAC              // Go into compile mode.
        .int EXIT               // Return from the function.
	#+end_src

        ; (SEMICOLON) is also elegantly simple.  Notice the F_IMMED flag.

	#+begin_src asm
        defword ";",1,F_IMMED,SEMICOLON
        .int LIT, EXIT, COMMA   // Append EXIT (so the word will return).
        .int LATEST, FETCH, HIDDEN // Toggle hidden flag -- unhide the word (see below for definition).
        .int LBRAC              // Go back to IMMEDIATE mode.
        .int EXIT               // Return from the function.
	#+end_src

* Extending the Compiler

        Words flagged with IMMEDIATE (F_IMMED) aren't just for the Forth compiler to use.  You can define
        your own IMMEDIATE words too, and this is a crucial aspect when extending basic Forth, because
        it allows you in effect to extend the compiler itself.  Does gcc let you do that?

        Standard Forth words like IF, WHILE, ." and so on are all written as extensions to the basic
        compiler, and are all IMMEDIATE words.

        The IMMEDIATE word toggles the F_IMMED (IMMEDIATE flag) on the most recently defined word,
        or on the current word if you call it in the middle of a definition.

        Typical usage is:

        : MYIMMEDWORD IMMEDIATE
                ...definition...
        ;

        but some Forth programmers write this instead:

        : MYIMMEDWORD
                ...definition...
        ; IMMEDIATE

        The two usages are equivalent, to a first approximation.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "IMMEDIATE",9,F_IMMED,IMMEDIATE
        movl var_LATEST,%edi    // LATEST word.
        addl $4,%edi            // Point to name/flags byte.
        xorb $F_IMMED,(%edi)    // Toggle the IMMED bit.
        NEXT
	#+end_src

        'addr HIDDEN' toggles the hidden flag (F_HIDDEN) of the word defined at addr.  To hide the
        most recently defined word (used above in : and ; definitions) you would do:

                LATEST @ HIDDEN

        'HIDE word' toggles the flag on a named 'word'.

        Setting this flag stops the word from being found by FIND, and so can be used to make 'private'
        words.  For example, to break up a large word into smaller parts you might do:

                : SUB1 ... subword ... ;
                : SUB2 ... subword ... ;
                : SUB3 ... subword ... ;
                : MAIN ... defined in terms of SUB1, SUB2, SUB3 ... ;
                HIDE SUB1
                HIDE SUB2
                HIDE SUB3

        After this, only MAIN is 'exported' or seen by the rest of the program.


	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "HIDDEN",6,,HIDDEN
        pop %edi                // Dictionary entry.
        addl $4,%edi            // Point to name/flags byte.
        xorb $F_HIDDEN,(%edi)   // Toggle the HIDDEN bit.
        NEXT

        defword "HIDE",4,,HIDE
        .int WORD               // Get the word (after HIDE).
        .int FIND               // Look up in the dictionary.
        .int HIDDEN             // Set F_HIDDEN flag.
        .int EXIT               // Return.
	#+end_src

        ' (TICK) is a standard Forth word which returns the codeword pointer of the next word.

        The common usage is:

        ' FOO ,

        which appends the codeword of FOO to the current word we are defining (this only works in compiled code).

        You tend to use ' in IMMEDIATE words.  For example an alternate (and rather useless) way to define
        a literal 2 might be:

        : LIT2 IMMEDIATE
                ' LIT ,         \ Appends LIT to the currently-being-defined word
                2 ,             \ Appends the number 2 to the currently-being-defined word
        ;

        So you could do:

        : DOUBLE LIT2 * ;

        (If you don't understand how LIT2 works, then you should review the material about compiling words
        and immediate mode).

        This definition of ' uses a cheat which I copied from buzzard92.  As a result it only works in
        compiled code.  It is possible to write a version of ' based on WORD, FIND, >CFA which works in
        immediate mode too.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "'",1,,TICK
        lodsl                   // Get the address of the next word and skip it.
        pushl %eax              // Push it on the stack.
        NEXT
	#+end_src

* Branching

        It turns out that all you need in order to define looping constructs, IF-statements, etc.
        are two primitives.

        BRANCH is an unconditional branch. 0BRANCH is a conditional branch (it only branches if the
        top of stack is zero).

        The diagram below shows how BRANCH works in some imaginary compiled word.  When BRANCH executes,
        %esi starts by pointing to the offset field (compare to LIT above):

	#+begin_example
        +---------------------+-------+---- - - ---+------------+------------+---- - - - ----+------------+
        | (Dictionary header) | DOCOL |            | BRANCH     | offset     | (skipped)     | word       |

                                                                   ^  |                       ^
                                                                   |  |                       |
                                                                   |  +-----------------------+

	#+end_example

        The offset is added to %esi to make the new %esi, and the result is that when NEXT runs, execution
        continues at the branch target.  Negative offsets work as expected.

        0BRANCH is the same except the branch happens conditionally.

        Now standard Forth words such as IF, THEN, ELSE, WHILE, REPEAT, etc. can be implemented entirely
        in Forth.  They are IMMEDIATE words which append various combinations of BRANCH or 0BRANCH
        into the word currently being compiled.

        As an example, code written like this:

                condition-code IF true-part THEN rest-code

        compiles to:

                condition-code 0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest-code
                                          |             ^
                                          |             |
                                          +-------------+

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "BRANCH",6,,BRANCH
        add (%esi),%esi         // add the offset to the instruction pointer
        NEXT

        defcode "0BRANCH",7,,ZBRANCH
        pop %eax
        test %eax,%eax          // top of stack is zero?

        lodsl                   // otherwise we need to skip the offset
        NEXT
	#+end_src

* Literal Strings

        LITSTRING is a primitive used to implement the ." and S" operators (which are written in
        Forth).  See the definition of those operators later.

        TELL just prints a string.  It's more efficient to define this in assembly because we
        can make it a single Linux syscall.

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "LITSTRING",9,,LITSTRING
        lodsl                   // get the length of the string
        push %esi               // push the address of the start of the string
        push %eax               // push it on the stack
        addl %eax,%esi          // skip past the string
        addl $3,%esi            // but round up to next 4 byte boundary
        andl $~3,%esi
        NEXT

        defcode "TELL",4,,TELL
        mov $1,%ebx             // 1st param: stdout
        pop %edx                // 3rd param: length of string
        pop %ecx                // 2nd param: address of string
        mov $__NR_write,%eax    // write syscall
        int $0x80
        NEXT
	#+end_src

* Quit and Interpret

        QUIT is the first Forth function called, almost immediately after the Forth system "boots".
        As explained before, QUIT doesn't "quit" anything.  It does some initialisation (in particular
        it clears the return stack) and it calls INTERPRET in a loop to interpret commands.  The
        reason it is called QUIT is because you can call it from your own Forth words in order to
        "quit" your program and start again at the user prompt.

        INTERPRET is the Forth interpreter ("toploop", "toplevel" or "REPL" might be a more accurate
        description -- see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL).

	#+begin_src asm
        // QUIT must not return (ie. must not call EXIT).
        defword "QUIT",4,,QUIT
        .int RZ,RSPSTORE        // R0 RSP!, clear the return stack
        .int INTERPRET          // interpret the next word
        .int BRANCH,-8          // and loop (indefinitely)
	#+end_src

        This interpreter is pretty simple, but remember that in Forth you can always override
        it later with a more powerful one!

	#+begin_src asm
        defcode "INTERPRET",9,,INTERPRET

* Odds and Ends

        CHAR puts the ASCII code of the first character of the following word on the stack.  For example
        CHAR A puts 65 on the stack.

        EXECUTE is used to run execution tokens.  See the discussion of execution tokens in the
        Forth code for more details.

        SYSCALL0, SYSCALL1, SYSCALL2, SYSCALL3 make a standard Linux system call.  (See <asm/unistd.h>
        for a list of system call numbers).  As their name suggests these forms take between 0 and 3
        syscall parameters, plus the system call number.

        In this Forth, SYSCALL0 must be the last word in the built-in (assembler) dictionary because we
        initialise the LATEST variable to point to it.  This means that if you want to extend the assembler
        part, you must put new words before SYSCALL0, or else change how LATEST is initialised.

* Data Segment

        Here we set up the Linux data segment, used for user definitions and variously known as just
        the 'data segment', 'user memory' or 'user definitions area'.  It is an area of memory which
        grows upwards and stores both newly-defined Forth words and global variables of various
        sorts.

        It is completely analogous to the C heap, except there is no generalised 'malloc' and 'free'
        (but as with everything in Forth, writing such functions would just be a Simple Matter
        Of Programming).  Instead in normal use the data segment just grows upwards as new Forth
        words are defined/appended to it.

        There are various "features" of the GNU toolchain which make setting up the data segment
        more complicated than it really needs to be.  One is the GNU linker which inserts a random
        "build ID" segment.  Another is Address Space Randomization which means we can't tell
        where the kernel will choose to place the data segment (or the stack for that matter).

        Therefore writing this set_up_data_segment assembler routine is a little more complicated
        than it really needs to be.  We ask the Linux kernel where it thinks the data segment starts
        using the brk(2) system call, then ask it to reserve some initial space (also using brk(2)).

        You don't need to worry about this code.

	#+begin_src asm
        .text
        .set INITIAL_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE,65536
set_up_data_segment:
        xor %ebx,%ebx           // Call brk(0)
        movl $__NR_brk,%eax
        int $0x80
        movl %eax,var_HERE      // Initialise HERE to point at beginning of data segment.
        addl $INITIAL_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE,%eax    // Reserve nn bytes of memory for initial data segment.
        movl %eax,%ebx          // Call brk(HERE+INITIAL_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE)
        movl $__NR_brk,%eax
        int $0x80
        ret
	#+end_src


        We allocate static buffers for the return static and input buffer (used when
        reading in files and text that the user types in).

	#+begin_src asm
        .set RETURN_STACK_SIZE,8192

/* This is used as a temporary input buffer when reading from files or the terminal. */
        .align 4096
buffer:
        .space BUFFER_SIZE
	#+end_src

* Start of Forth Code

        We've now reached the stage where the Forth system is running and self-hosting.  All further
        words can be written as Forth itself, including words like IF, THEN, .", etc which in most
        languages would be considered rather fundamental.

        I used to append this here in the assembly file, but I got sick of fighting against gas's
        crack-smoking (lack of) multiline string syntax.  So now that is in a separate file called
        jonesforth.f

#+begin_src forth
\	START OF Forth CODE ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\	We've now reached the stage where the Forth system is running and self-hosting.  All further
\	words can be written as Forth itself, including words like IF, THEN, .", etc which in most
\	languages would be considered rather fundamental.
\
\	Some notes about the code:
\
\	I use indenting to show structure.  The amount of whitespace has no meaning to Forth however
\	except that you must use at least one whitespace character between words, and words themselves
\	cannot contain whitespace.
\
\	Forth is case-sensitive.  Use capslock!

\ The primitive word /MOD (DIVMOD) leaves both the quotient and the remainder on the stack.  (On
\ i386, the idivl instruction gives both anyway).  Now we can define the / and MOD in terms of /MOD
\ and a few other primitives.
: / /MOD SWAP DROP ;
: MOD /MOD DROP ;

\ Define some character constants
: '\n' 10 ;
: BL   32 ; \ BL (BLank) is a standard Forth word for space.

\ CR prints a carriage return
: CR '\n' EMIT ;

\ SPACE prints a space
: SPACE BL EMIT ;

\ NEGATE leaves the negative of a number on the stack.
: NEGATE 0 SWAP - ;

\ Standard words for booleans.
: TRUE  1 ;
: FALSE 0 ;
: NOT   0= ;

\ LITERAL takes whatever is on the stack and compiles LIT <foo>
: LITERAL IMMEDIATE
	' LIT ,		\ compile LIT
	,		\ compile the literal itself (from the stack)
	;

\ Now we can use [ and ] to insert literals which are calculated at compile time.  (Recall that
\ [ and ] are the Forth words which switch into and out of immediate mode.)
\ Within definitions, use [ ... ] LITERAL anywhere that '...' is a constant expression which you
\ would rather only compute once (at compile time, rather than calculating it each time your word runs).
: ':'
	[		\ go into immediate mode (temporarily)
	CHAR :		\ push the number 58 (ASCII code of colon) on the parameter stack
	]		\ go back to compile mode
	LITERAL		\ compile LIT 58 as the definition of ':' word
;

\ A few more character constants defined the same way as above.
: ';' [ CHAR ; ] LITERAL ;
: '(' [ CHAR ( ] LITERAL ;
: ')' [ CHAR ) ] LITERAL ;
: '"' [ CHAR " ] LITERAL ;
: 'A' [ CHAR A ] LITERAL ;
: '0' [ CHAR 0 ] LITERAL ;
: '-' [ CHAR - ] LITERAL ;
: '.' [ CHAR . ] LITERAL ;

\ While compiling, '[COMPILE] word' compiles 'word' if it would otherwise be IMMEDIATE.
: [COMPILE] IMMEDIATE
	WORD		\ get the next word
	FIND		\ find it in the dictionary
	>CFA		\ get its codeword
	,		\ and compile that
;

\ RECURSE makes a recursive call to the current word that is being compiled.
\
\ Normally while a word is being compiled, it is marked HIDDEN so that references to the
\ same word within are calls to the previous definition of the word.  However we still have
\ access to the word which we are currently compiling through the LATEST pointer so we
\ can use that to compile a recursive call.
: RECURSE IMMEDIATE
	LATEST @	\ LATEST points to the word being compiled at the moment

;

\	CONTROL STRUCTURES ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ So far we have defined only very simple definitions.  Before we can go further, we really need to
\ make some control structures, like IF ... THEN and loops.  Luckily we can define arbitrary control
\ structures directly in Forth.
\
\ Please note that the control structures as I have defined them here will only work inside compiled
\ words.  If you try to type in expressions using IF, etc. in immediate mode, then they won't work.
\ Making these work in immediate mode is left as an exercise for the reader.

\ condition IF true-part THEN rest
\	-- compiles to: --> condition 0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest
\	where OFFSET is the offset of 'rest'
\ condition IF true-part ELSE false-part THEN
\ 	-- compiles to: --> condition 0BRANCH OFFSET true-part BRANCH OFFSET2 false-part rest
\	where OFFSET if the offset of false-part and OFFSET2 is the offset of rest

\ IF is an IMMEDIATE word which compiles 0BRANCH followed by a dummy offset, and places
\ the address of the 0BRANCH on the stack.  Later when we see THEN, we pop that address
\ off the stack, calculate the offset, and back-fill the offset.
: IF IMMEDIATE
	' 0BRANCH ,	\ compile 0BRANCH
	HERE @		\ save location of the offset on the stack
	0 ,		\ compile a dummy offset
;

: THEN IMMEDIATE
	DUP
	HERE @ SWAP -	\ calculate the offset from the address saved on the stack
	SWAP !		\ store the offset in the back-filled location
;

: ELSE IMMEDIATE
	' BRANCH ,	\ definite branch to just over the false-part
	HERE @		\ save location of the offset on the stack
	0 ,		\ compile a dummy offset
	SWAP		\ now back-fill the original (IF) offset
	DUP		\ same as for THEN word above
	HERE @ SWAP -
	SWAP !
;

\ BEGIN loop-part condition UNTIL
\	-- compiles to: --> loop-part condition 0BRANCH OFFSET
\	where OFFSET points back to the loop-part
\ This is like do { loop-part } while (condition) in the C language
: BEGIN IMMEDIATE
	HERE @		\ save location on the stack
;

: UNTIL IMMEDIATE
	' 0BRANCH ,	\ compile 0BRANCH
	HERE @ -	\ calculate the offset from the address saved on the stack
	,		\ compile the offset here
;

\ BEGIN loop-part AGAIN
\	-- compiles to: --> loop-part BRANCH OFFSET
\	where OFFSET points back to the loop-part
\ In other words, an infinite loop which can only be returned from with EXIT
: AGAIN IMMEDIATE
	' BRANCH ,	\ compile BRANCH
	HERE @ -	\ calculate the offset back
	,		\ compile the offset here
;

\ BEGIN condition WHILE loop-part REPEAT
\	-- compiles to: --> condition 0BRANCH OFFSET2 loop-part BRANCH OFFSET
\	where OFFSET points back to condition (the beginning) and OFFSET2 points to after the whole piece of code
\ So this is like a while (condition) { loop-part } loop in the C language
: WHILE IMMEDIATE
	' 0BRANCH ,	\ compile 0BRANCH
	HERE @		\ save location of the offset2 on the stack
	0 ,		\ compile a dummy offset2
;

: REPEAT IMMEDIATE
	' BRANCH ,	\ compile BRANCH
	SWAP		\ get the original offset (from BEGIN)
	HERE @ - ,	\ and compile it after BRANCH
	DUP
	HERE @ SWAP -	\ calculate the offset2
	SWAP !		\ and back-fill it in the original location
;

\ UNLESS is the same as IF but the test is reversed.
\
\ Note the use of [COMPILE]: Since IF is IMMEDIATE we don't want it to be executed while UNLESS
\ is compiling, but while UNLESS is running (which happens to be when whatever word using UNLESS is
\ being compiled -- whew!).  So we use [COMPILE] to reverse the effect of marking IF as immediate.
\ This trick is generally used when we want to write our own control words without having to
\ implement them all in terms of the primitives 0BRANCH and BRANCH, but instead reusing simpler
\ control words like (in this instance) IF.
: UNLESS IMMEDIATE
	' NOT ,		\ compile NOT (to reverse the test)
	[COMPILE] IF	\ continue by calling the normal IF
;

\	COMMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Forth allows ( ... ) as comments within function definitions.  This works by having an IMMEDIATE
\ word called ( which just drops input characters until it hits the corresponding ).
: ( IMMEDIATE
	1		\ allowed nested parens by keeping track of depth

	From now on we can use ( ... ) for comments.

	STACK NOTATION ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	In Forth style we can also use ( ... -- ... ) to show the effects that a word has on the
	parameter stack.  For example:

	( n -- )	means that the word consumes an integer (n) from the parameter stack.
	( b a -- c )	means that the word uses two integers (a and b, where a is at the top of stack)
				and returns a single integer (c).
	( -- )		means the word has no effect on the stack
)

( Some more complicated stack examples, showing the stack notation. )
: NIP ( x y -- y ) SWAP DROP ;
: TUCK ( x y -- y x y ) SWAP OVER ;
: PICK ( x_u ... x_1 x_0 u -- x_u ... x_1 x_0 x_u )

	4 *		( multiply by the word size )
	DSP@ +		( add to the stack pointer )
	@    		( and fetch )

(
	PRINTING NUMBERS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	The standard Forth word . (DOT) is very important.  It takes the number at the top
	of the stack and prints it out.  However first I'm going to implement some lower-level
	Forth words:

	U.R	( u width -- )	which prints an unsigned number, padded to a certain width
	U.	( u -- )	which prints an unsigned number
	.R	( n width -- )	which prints a signed number, padded to a certain width.

	For example:
		-123 6 .R
	will print out these characters:
		<space> <space> - 1 2 3

	In other words, the number padded left to a certain number of characters.

	The full number is printed even if it is wider than width, and this is what allows us to
	define the ordinary functions U. and . (we just set width to zero knowing that the full
	number will be printed anyway).

	Another wrinkle of . and friends is that they obey the current base in the variable BASE.
	BASE can be anything in the range 2 to 36.

	While we're defining . &c we can also define .S which is a useful debugging tool.  This
	word prints the current stack (non-destructively) from top to bottom.
)

( This is the underlying recursive definition of U. )
: U.		( u -- )
	BASE @ /MOD	( width rem quot )
	?DUP IF			( if quotient <> 0 then )
		RECURSE		( print the quotient )
	THEN

	( print the remainder )
	DUP 10 < IF
		'0'		( decimal digits 0..9 )
	ELSE
		10 -		( hex and beyond digits A..Z )
		'A'
	THEN
	+
	EMIT

	DROP

	BASE @ /	( rem quot )

	  a negative number of spaces anyway, so it's now safe to call SPACES ... )
	SPACES
	( ... and then call the underlying implementation of U. )
	U.
;

(
	.R prints a signed number, padded to a certain width.  We can't just print the sign
	and call U.R because we want the sign to be next to the number ('-123' instead of '-  123').

(
	STRINGS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	S" string" is used in Forth to define strings.  It leaves the address of the string and
	its length on the stack, (length at the top of stack).  The space following S" is the normal
	space between Forth words and is not a part of the string.

	This is tricky to define because it has to do different things depending on whether
	we are compiling or in immediate mode.  (Thus the word is marked IMMEDIATE so it can
	detect this and do different things).

	In compile mode we append
		LITSTRING <string length> <string rounded up 4 bytes>
	to the current word.  The primitive LITSTRING does the right thing when the current
	word is executed.

	In immediate mode there isn't a particularly good place to put the string, but in this
	case we put the string at HERE (but we _don't_ change HERE).  This is meant as a temporary
	location, likely to be overwritten soon after.
)
( C, appends a byte to the current compiled word. )

	HERE @ C!	( store the character in the compiled image )
	1 HERE +!	( increment HERE pointer by 1 byte )

(
	." is the print string operator in Forth.  Example: ." Something to print"
	The space after the operator is the ordinary space required between words and is not
	a part of what is printed.

	In immediate mode we just keep reading characters and printing them until we get to
	the next double quote.

	In compile mode we use S" to store the string, then add TELL afterwards:
		LITSTRING <string length> <string rounded up to 4 bytes> TELL

	It may be interesting to note the use of [COMPILE] to turn the call to the immediate
	word S" into compilation of that word.  It compiles it into the definition of .",
	not into the definition of the word being compiled when this is running (complicated
	enough for you?)

(
	CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	In Forth, global constants and variables are defined like this:

	10 CONSTANT TEN		when TEN is executed, it leaves the integer 10 on the stack
	VARIABLE VAR		when VAR is executed, it leaves the address of VAR on the stack

	Constants can be read but not written, eg:

	TEN . CR		prints 10

	You can read a variable (in this example called VAR) by doing:

	VAR @			leaves the value of VAR on the stack
	VAR @ . CR		prints the value of VAR
	VAR ? CR		same as above, since ? is the same as @ .

	and update the variable by doing:

	20 VAR !		sets VAR to 20

	Note that variables are uninitialised (but see VALUE later on which provides initialised
	variables with a slightly simpler syntax).

	How can we define the words CONSTANT and VARIABLE?

	The trick is to define a new word for the variable itself (eg. if the variable was called
	'VAR' then we would define a new word called VAR).  This is easy to do because we exposed
	dictionary entry creation through the CREATE word (part of the definition of : above).
	A call to WORD [TEN] CREATE (where [TEN] means that "TEN" is the next word in the input)
	leaves the dictionary entry:

				   +--- HERE
				   |
				   V
	+---------+---+---+---+---+
	| LINK    | 3 | T | E | N |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+
                   len

	For CONSTANT we can continue by appending DOCOL (the codeword), then LIT followed by
	the constant itself and then EXIT, forming a little word definition that returns the
	constant:

	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 3 | T | E | N | DOCOL      | LIT        | 10         | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len              codeword

	Notice that this word definition is exactly the same as you would have got if you had
	written : TEN 10 ;

	Note for people reading the code below: DOCOL is a constant word which we defined in the
	assembler part which returns the value of the assembler symbol of the same name.
)
: CONSTANT
	WORD		( get the name (the name follows CONSTANT) )
	CREATE		( make the dictionary entry )
	DOCOL ,		( append DOCOL (the codeword field of this word) )
	' LIT ,		( append the codeword LIT )
	,		( append the value on the top of the stack )
	' EXIT ,	( append the codeword EXIT )
;

(
	VARIABLE is a little bit harder because we need somewhere to put the variable.  There is
	nothing particularly special about the user memory (the area of memory pointed to by HERE
	where we have previously just stored new word definitions).  We can slice off bits of this
	memory area to store anything we want, so one possible definition of VARIABLE might create
	this:

	   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
	   |								  |
	   V								  |
	+---------+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+---|--------+------------+
	| <var>   | LINK    | 3 | V | A | R | DOCOL      | LIT        | <addr var> | EXIT       |
	+---------+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
        		     len              codeword

	where <var> is the place to store the variable, and <addr var> points back to it.

	To make this more general let's define a couple of words which we can use to allocate
	arbitrary memory from the user memory.

	First ALLOT, where n ALLOT allocates n bytes of memory.  (Note when calling this that
	it's a very good idea to make sure that n is a multiple of 4, or at least that next time
	a word is compiled that HERE has been left as a multiple of 4).
)
: ALLOT		( n -- addr )
	HERE @ SWAP	( here n )
	HERE +!		( adds n to HERE, after this the old value of HERE is still on the stack )
;

(
	Second, CELLS.  In Forth the phrase 'n CELLS ALLOT' means allocate n integers of whatever size
	is the natural size for integers on this machine architecture.  On this 32 bit machine therefore
	CELLS just multiplies the top of stack by 4.
)
: CELLS ( n -- n ) 4 * ;

(
	So now we can define VARIABLE easily in much the same way as CONSTANT above.  Refer to the
	diagram above to see what the word that this creates will look like.
)
: VARIABLE
	1 CELLS ALLOT	( allocate 1 cell of memory, push the pointer to this memory )
	WORD CREATE	( make the dictionary entry (the name follows VARIABLE) )
	DOCOL ,		( append DOCOL (the codeword field of this word) )
	' LIT ,		( append the codeword LIT )
	,		( append the pointer to the new memory )
	' EXIT ,	( append the codeword EXIT )
;

(
	VALUES ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	VALUEs are like VARIABLEs but with a simpler syntax.  You would generally use them when you
	want a variable which is read often, and written infrequently.

	20 VALUE VAL 	creates VAL with initial value 20
	VAL		pushes the value (20) directly on the stack
	30 TO VAL	updates VAL, setting it to 30
	VAL		pushes the value (30) directly on the stack

	Notice that 'VAL' on its own doesn't return the address of the value, but the value itself,
	making values simpler and more obvious to use than variables (no indirection through '@').
	The price is a more complicated implementation, although despite the complexity there is no
	performance penalty at runtime.

	A naive implementation of 'TO' would be quite slow, involving a dictionary search each time.
	But because this is Forth we have complete control of the compiler so we can compile TO more
	efficiently, turning:
		TO VAL
	into:
		LIT <addr> !
	and calculating <addr> (the address of the value) at compile time.

	Now this is the clever bit.  We'll compile our value like this:

	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 3 | V | A | L | DOCOL      | LIT        | <value>    | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len              codeword

	where <value> is the actual value itself.  Note that when VAL executes, it will push the
	value on the stack, which is what we want.

	But what will TO use for the address <addr>?  Why of course a pointer to that <value>:

		code compiled	- - - - --+------------+------------+------------+-- - - - -
		by TO VAL		  | LIT        | <addr>     | !          |
				- - - - --+------------+-----|------+------------+-- - - - -
							     |
							     V
	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 3 | V | A | L | DOCOL      | LIT        | <value>    | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len              codeword

	In other words, this is a kind of self-modifying code.

	way cannot be inlined).

(
	FORGET ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	So far we have only allocated words and memory.  Forth provides a rather primitive method
	to deallocate.

	'FORGET word' deletes the definition of 'word' from the dictionary and everything defined
	after it, including any variables and other memory allocated after.

	The implementation is very simple - we look up the word (which returns the dictionary entry
	address).  Then we set HERE to point to that address, so in effect all future allocations
	and definitions will overwrite memory starting at the word.  We also need to set LATEST to
	point to the previous word.

	Note that you cannot FORGET built-in words (well, you can try but it will probably cause
	a segfault).

	XXX: Because we wrote VARIABLE to store the variable in memory allocated before the word,
	in the current implementation VARIABLE FOO FORGET FOO will leak 1 cell of memory.

	CASE ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	CASE...ENDCASE is how we do switch statements in Forth.  There is no generally
	agreed syntax for this, so I've gone for the syntax mandated by the ISO standard
	Forth (ANS-Forth).

		( some value on the stack )
		CASE
		test1 OF ... ENDOF
		test2 OF ... ENDOF
		testn OF ... ENDOF
		... ( default case )
		ENDCASE

	The CASE statement tests the value on the stack by comparing it for equality with
	test1, test2, ..., testn and executes the matching piece of code within OF ... ENDOF.
	If none of the test values match then the default case is executed.  Inside the ... of
	the default case, the value is still at the top of stack (it is implicitly DROP-ed
	by ENDCASE).  When ENDOF is executed it jumps after ENDCASE (ie. there is no "fall-through"
	and no need for a break statement like in C).

	The default case may be omitted.  In fact the tests may also be omitted so that you
	just have a default case, although this is probably not very useful.

	An example (assuming that 'q', etc. are words which push the ASCII value of the letter
	on the stack):

		0 VALUE QUIT
		0 VALUE SLEEP
		KEY CASE
			'q' OF 1 TO QUIT ENDOF
			's' OF 1 TO SLEEP ENDOF
			( default case: )
			." Sorry, I didn't understand key <" DUP EMIT ." >, try again." CR
		ENDCASE

	(In some versions of Forth, more advanced tests are supported, such as ranges, etc.
	Other versions of Forth need you to write OTHERWISE to indicate the default case.
	As I said above, this Forth tries to follow the ANS Forth standard).

	The implementation of CASE...ENDCASE is somewhat non-trivial.  I'm following the
	implementations from here:
	http://www.uni-giessen.de/faq/archiv/forthfaq.case_endcase/msg00000.html

	The general plan is to compile the code as a series of IF statements:

	CASE				(push 0 on the immediate-mode parameter stack)
	test1 OF ... ENDOF		test1 OVER = IF DROP ... ELSE
	test2 OF ... ENDOF		test2 OVER = IF DROP ... ELSE
	testn OF ... ENDOF		testn OVER = IF DROP ... ELSE
	... ( default case )		...
	ENDCASE				DROP THEN [THEN [THEN ...]]

	The CASE statement pushes 0 on the immediate-mode parameter stack, and that number
	is used to count how many THEN statements we need when we get to ENDCASE so that each
	IF has a matching THEN.  The counting is done implicitly.  If you recall from the
	implementation above of IF, each IF pushes a code address on the immediate-mode stack,
	and these addresses are non-zero, so by the time we get to ENDCASE the stack contains
	some number of non-zeroes, followed by a zero.  The number of non-zeroes is how many
	times IF has been called, so how many times we need to match it with THEN.

	CFA> is the opposite of >CFA.  It takes a codeword and tries to find the matching
	dictionary definition.  (In truth, it works with any pointer into a word, not just
	the codeword pointer, and this is needed to do stack traces).

	In this Forth this is not so easy.  In fact we have to search through the dictionary
	because we don't have a convenient back-pointer (as is often the case in other versions
	of Forth).  Because of this search, CFA> should not be used when performance is critical,
	so it is only used for debugging tools such as the decompiler and printing stack
	traces.

	This word returns 0 if it doesn't find a match.

	EXECUTION TOKENS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Standard Forth defines a concept called an 'execution token' (or 'xt') which is very
	similar to a function pointer in C.  We map the execution token to a codeword address.

			execution token of DOUBLE is the address of this codeword
						    |
						    V
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword					       ^

	There is one assembler primitive for execution tokens, EXECUTE ( xt -- ), which runs them.

	You can make an execution token for an existing word the long way using >CFA,
	ie: WORD [foo] FIND >CFA will push the xt for foo onto the stack where foo is the
	next word in input.  So a very slow way to run DOUBLE might be:

		: DOUBLE DUP + ;
		: SLOW WORD FIND >CFA EXECUTE ;
		5 SLOW DOUBLE . CR	\ prints 10

	We also offer a simpler and faster way to get the execution token of any word FOO:

		['] FOO

	(Exercises for readers: (1) What is the difference between ['] FOO and ' FOO?
	(2) What is the relationship between ', ['] and LIT?)

	More useful is to define anonymous words and/or to assign xt's to variables.

	To define an anonymous word (and push its xt on the stack) use :NONAME ... ; as in this
	example:

		:NONAME ." anon word was called" CR ;	\ pushes xt on the stack
		DUP EXECUTE EXECUTE			\ executes the anon word twice

	Stack parameters work as expected:

		:NONAME ." called with parameter " . CR ;
		DUP
		10 SWAP EXECUTE		\ prints 'called with parameter 10'
		20 SWAP EXECUTE		\ prints 'called with parameter 20'

	Notice that the above code has a memory leak: the anonymous word is still compiled
	into the data segment, so even if you lose track of the xt, the word continues to
	occupy memory.  A good way to keep track of the xt and thus avoid the memory leak is
	to assign it to a CONSTANT, VARIABLE or VALUE:

		0 VALUE ANON
		:NONAME ." anon word was called" CR ; TO ANON
		ANON EXECUTE
		ANON EXECUTE

	Another use of :NONAME is to create an array of functions which can be called quickly
	(think: fast switch statement).  This example is adapted from the ANS Forth standard:

		10 CELLS ALLOT CONSTANT CMD-TABLE
		: SET-CMD CELLS CMD-TABLE + ! ;
		: CALL-CMD CELLS CMD-TABLE + @ EXECUTE ;

		:NONAME ." alternate 0 was called" CR ;	 0 SET-CMD
		:NONAME ." alternate 1 was called" CR ;	 1 SET-CMD
			\ etc...
		:NONAME ." alternate 9 was called" CR ;	 9 SET-CMD

		0 CALL-CMD
		1 CALL-CMD
)

: :NONAME
	0 0 CREATE	( create a word with no name - we need a dictionary header because ; expects it )
	HERE @		( current HERE value is the address of the codeword, ie. the xt )
	DOCOL ,		( compile DOCOL (the codeword) )
	]		( go into compile mode )
;

: ['] IMMEDIATE
	' LIT ,		( compile LIT )
;

(
	EXCEPTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Amazingly enough, exceptions can be implemented directly in Forth, in fact rather easily.

	The general usage is as follows:

		: FOO ( n -- ) THROW ;

		: TEST-EXCEPTIONS
			25 ['] FOO CATCH	\ execute 25 FOO, catching any exception
			?DUP IF
				." called FOO and it threw exception number: "
				. CR
				DROP		\ we have to drop the argument of FOO (25)
			THEN
		;
		\ prints: called FOO and it threw exception number: 25

	CATCH runs an execution token and detects whether it throws any exception or not.  The
	stack signature of CATCH is rather complicated:

		( a_n-1 ... a_1 a_0 xt -- r_m-1 ... r_1 r_0 0 )		if xt did NOT throw an exception
		( a_n-1 ... a_1 a_0 xt -- ?_n-1 ... ?_1 ?_0 e )		if xt DID throw exception 'e'

	where a_i and r_i are the (arbitrary number of) argument and return stack contents
	before and after xt is EXECUTEd.  Notice in particular the case where an exception
	is thrown, the stack pointer is restored so that there are n of _something_ on the
	stack in the positions where the arguments a_i used to be.  We don't really guarantee
	what is on the stack -- perhaps the original arguments, and perhaps other nonsense --
	it largely depends on the implementation of the word that was executed.

	THROW, ABORT and a few others throw exceptions.

	Exception numbers are non-zero integers.  By convention the positive numbers can be used
	for app-specific exceptions and the negative numbers have certain meanings defined in
	the ANS Forth standard.  (For example, -1 is the exception thrown by ABORT).

	0 THROW does nothing.  This is the stack signature of THROW:

		( 0 -- )
		( * e -- ?_n-1 ... ?_1 ?_0 e )	the stack is restored to the state from the corresponding CATCH

	The implementation hangs on the definitions of CATCH and THROW and the state shared
	between them.

	Up to this point, the return stack has consisted merely of a list of return addresses,
	with the top of the return stack being the return address where we will resume executing
	when the current word EXITs.  However CATCH will push a more complicated 'exception stack
	frame' on the return stack.  The exception stack frame records some things about the
	state of execution at the time that CATCH was called.

	When called, THROW walks up the return stack (the process is called 'unwinding') until
	it finds the exception stack frame.  It then uses the data in the exception stack frame
	to restore the state allowing execution to continue after the matching CATCH.  (If it
	unwinds the stack and doesn't find the exception stack frame then it prints a message
	and drops back to the prompt, which is also normal behaviour for so-called 'uncaught
	exceptions').

	This is what the exception stack frame looks like.  (As is conventional, the return stack
	is shown growing downwards from higher to lower memory addresses).

		+------------------------------+
		| return address from CATCH    |   Notice this is already on the
		|                              |   return stack when CATCH is called.
		+------------------------------+
		| original parameter stack     |
		| pointer                      |
		+------------------------------+  ^
		| exception stack marker       |  |
		| (EXCEPTION-MARKER)           |  |   Direction of stack
		+------------------------------+  |   unwinding by THROW.
						  |
						  |

	The EXCEPTION-MARKER marks the entry as being an exception stack frame rather than an
	ordinary return address, and it is this which THROW "notices" as it is unwinding the
	stack.  (If you want to implement more advanced exceptions such as TRY...WITH then
	you'll need to use a different value of marker if you want the old and new exception stack
	frame layouts to coexist).

	What happens if the executed word doesn't throw an exception?  It will eventually
	return and call EXCEPTION-MARKER, so EXCEPTION-MARKER had better do something sensible
	without us needing to modify EXIT.  This nicely gives us a suitable definition of
	EXCEPTION-MARKER, namely a function that just drops the stack frame and itself
	returns (thus "returning" from the original CATCH).

	One thing to take from this is that exceptions are a relatively lightweight mechanism
	in Forth.

	C STRINGS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Forth strings are represented by a start address and length kept on the stack or in memory.

	Most Forths don't handle C strings, but we need them in order to access the process arguments
	and environment left on the stack by the Linux kernel, and to make some system calls.

	For example, DUP STRLEN TELL prints a C string.
)

(
	Z" .." is like S" ..." except that the string is terminated by an ASCII NUL character.

	To make it more like a C string, at runtime Z" just leaves the address of the string
	on the stack (not address & length as with S").  To implement this we need to add the
	extra NUL to the string and also a DROP instruction afterwards.  Apart from that the

(
	THE ENVIRONMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Linux makes the process arguments and environment available to us on the stack.

	The top of stack pointer is saved by the early assembler code when we start up in the Forth
	variable S0, and starting at this pointer we can read out the command line arguments and the
	environment.

	Starting at S0, S0 itself points to argc (the number of command line arguments).

	S0+4 points to argv[0], S0+8 points to argv[1] etc up to argv[argc-1].

	argv[argc] is a NULL pointer.

	After that the stack contains environment variables, a set of pointers to strings of the
	form NAME=VALUE and on until we get to another NULL pointer.

	The first word that we define, ARGC, pushes the number of command line arguments (note that
	as with C argc, this includes the name of the command).
)
: ARGC
	S0 @ @
;

(
	n ARGV gets the nth command line argument.

	For example to print the command name you would do:
		0 ARGV TELL CR

	1+ CELLS S0 @ +	( get the address of argv[n] entry )
	@		( get the address of the string )
	DUP STRLEN	( and get its length / turn it into a Forth string )
;

(
	ENVIRON returns the address of the first environment string.  The list of strings ends
	with a NULL pointer.

	For example to print the first string in the environment you could do:
		ENVIRON @ DUP STRLEN TELL
)
: ENVIRON	( -- addr )
	ARGC		( number of command line parameters on the stack to skip )

	MORECORE increases the data segment by the specified number of (4 byte) cells.

	NB. The number of cells requested should normally be a multiple of 1024.  The
	reason is that Linux can't extend the data segment by less than a single page
	(4096 bytes or 1024 cells).

	This Forth doesn't automatically increase the size of the data segment "on demand"
	(ie. when , (COMMA), ALLOT, CREATE, and so on are used).  Instead the programmer
	needs to be aware of how much space a large allocation will take, check UNUSED, and
	call MORECORE if necessary.  A simple programming exercise is to change the
	implementation of the data segment so that MORECORE is called automatically if
	the program needs more memory.

	ASSEMBLER CODE ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is just the outline of a simple assembler, allowing you to write Forth primitives

	Assembly primitives begin ': NAME' in the normal way, but are ended with ;CODE.  ;CODE
	updates the header so that the codeword isn't DOCOL, but points instead to the assembled
	code (in the DFA part of the word).

	We provide a convenience macro NEXT (you guessed what it does).  However you don't need to
	use it because ;CODE will put a NEXT at the end of your word.

	The rest consists of some immediate words which expand into machine code appended to the
	definition of the word.  Only a very tiny part of the i386 assembly space is covered, just
	enough to write a few assembler primitives below.

(
	INLINE can be used to inline an assembler primitive into the current (assembler)
	word.

	For example:

		: 2DROP INLINE DROP INLINE DROP ;CODE

	will build an efficient assembler word 2DROP which contains the inline assembly code
	for DROP followed by DROP (eg. two 'pop %eax' instructions in this case).

	Another example.  Consider this ordinary Forth definition:

		: C@++ ( addr -- addr+1 byte ) DUP 1+ SWAP C@ ;

	(it is equivalent to the C operation '*p++' where p is a pointer to char).  If we
	notice that all of the words used to define C@++ are in fact assembler primitives,
	then we can write a faster (but equivalent) definition like this:

		: C@++ INLINE DUP INLINE 1+ INLINE SWAP INLINE C@ ;CODE

	One interesting point to note is that this "concatenative" style of programming
	allows you to write assembler words portably.  The above definition would work
	for any CPU architecture.

	There are several conditions that must be met for INLINE to be used successfully:

	(1) You must be currently defining an assembler word (ie. : ... ;CODE).

	(2) The word that you are inlining must be known to be an assembler word.  If you try
	to inline a Forth word, you'll get an error message.

	(3) The assembler primitive must be position-independent code and must end with a
	single NEXT macro.

	Exercises for the reader: (a) Generalise INLINE so that it can inline Forth words when
	building Forth words. (b) Further generalise INLINE so that it does something sensible
	when you try to inline Forth into assembler and vice versa.

	The implementation of INLINE is pretty simple.  We find the word in the dictionary,
	check it's an assembler word, then copy it into the current definition, byte by byte,
	until we reach the NEXT macro (which is not copied).
