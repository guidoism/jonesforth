## Jonesforth for multiple architectures

The plan is to create a nicely typeset copy of Jonesforth, and while we're
at it we'll port it to a bunch of other archictures for comparision and education,
and explore other forms of visualizations and memory architectures.

## Ideas

- Show hex for opcodes, ascii for text, numbers for numbers -- And color code them while displaying the memory layout.

## Other Tools

[Online x86 / x64 Assembler](https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm) and [OakSim ARM Simulator](https://wunkolo.github.io/OakSim/) and [ARM Converter](http://armconverter.com/)

The NEXT macro using an [indirect branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_branch) and compiles on x86 to `ADFFE0`.
